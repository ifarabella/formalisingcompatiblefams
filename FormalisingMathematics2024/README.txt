These files have been submitted as part of project 3 of FM24.

padicgaloisrep.lean was submitted for project 2. I have left it as it was when I submitted (I will
eventually improve the code using the feedback). It is attatched since it is needed as an import.
PLEASE NOTE THAT IT HAS NOT BEEN SUBMITTED FOR CREDIT FOR PROJECT 3.

The files submitted for credit are CompatibleFamily.lean, AssociatedPrime.lean,
IsFrobeniusAgrees.lean. These three I had in a subfolder of
FormalisingMathematics2024 called CW3. padicgaloisrep.lean was in a different subfolder
called CW2


`CompatibleFamily.TrivialFamily` and `CompatibleFamily.FamilyFromHom` probably belong in
padicgaloisrep.lean where they are examples but since I didn't want to change anything in that file
and I didn't have them as definitions there

As part of my submission, I'll attatch the pdf for the second project for reference for 
`padicgaloisrep.lean`.

Lots of thanks to Kevin Buzzard and all the GTAs.

All mistakes are my own.
